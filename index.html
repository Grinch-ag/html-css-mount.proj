  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.

      <h2>Ranking of the world's deadliest peaks</h2>
      <p>Okay, here we go. Let's start our rating with less dangerous peaks.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="5" class="box">
      <h3>5. Kanchenjunga, 8586m</h3>
      <div class="img"><img src="./assets/images/kanchenjunga.jpg" class="image" alt="mountain kanchenjunga" /></div>
      <div class="textblock"><p>
        <strong>Mortality rate - 12.7%.</strong>
        Kanchenjunga, the third eight-thousandth mountain after Everest and K2,
        opens our rating. It is located in a remote area. The mountain has
        gained a very terrible fame just among women. For some reason it lets
        men in, while the opposite sex is mostly killed. There are only a few
        women who went up and came down alive, so for a long time the summit was
        impregnable just for the female half of humanity.
      </p></div>

    <div id="4" class="box">
      <h3>4. Dhaulagiri 8167 m</h3>
      <div class="img"><img src="./assets/images/dhaulagiri.jpg" class="image" alt="mountain dhaulagiri" /></div>
      <div class="textblock"><p><strong>Mortality rate - 15.6%.</strong> It is noteworthy that despite its low altitude (the seventh peak of the world), Dhaulagiri is considered one of the most difficult eight-thousanders on the classic route. The reason for this is primarily avalanches, as well as falls and derailments, as the route runs along a very steep slope. The weather conditions for ascents are more favorable in spring and slightly worse in autumn.</p></div>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div id="3" class="box">
      <h3>3. Chogory (K2) 8611 m</h3>
      <div class="img"><img src="./assets/images/k2.jpg" class="image" alt="mountain K2" /></div>
      <div class="textblock"><p><strong>Mortality rate - 19%.</strong> Often the summit of K2 (the world's second highest peak) tops the rankings among the most dangerous mountains. This is partly justified, as the mortality rate until recently was 42%. That is, practically every second person who went to the summit, did not return from it.</p></div>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div id="2" class="box">
      <h3>2. Nanga Parbat 8126 m</h3>
      <div class="img"><img src="./assets/images/nanga.jpg" class="image" alt="mountain nanga parbat" /></div>
      <div class="textblock"><p><strong>Mortality rate - 21%.</strong> Pakistani peak, the ninth eight-thousandth peak in the world. Some of the fatalities were not the fault of the mountain. The fact is that Pakistan often has a turbulent political environment. In 2013, part of the base camp was shot by the local Taliban. Unfortunately, many climbers died, including three Ukrainians. All of them are also included in the mountain's mortality rate. If we do not take into account the terrorist attack, the main causes of death on Nanga Parbat are also avalanches and falls from the wall. By the way, the Diamir Valley is considered one of the most beautiful places where the base camp is located. It is a large green area, above which rises the three-kilometer Diamir wall.</p></div>

    <div id="1" class="box">
      <h3>1. Annapurna I 8091 m</h3>
      <div class="img"><img src="./assets/images/annapurna_1.jpg" class="image" alt="mountain annapurna" /></div>
      <div class="textblock"><p><strong>Mortality rate - 26,7%.</strong> The first place in the ranking of the world's deadliest peaks is occupied by Annapurna I. The mountain is one of the ten highest peaks in the world, but it is still the most dangerous. For all time on its peak only 266 people have been successfully visited - this is the smallest number of climbers among all eight-thousanders. The main cause of death is avalanches. But at the same time - it is the first eight-thousanders, which was climbed by a man. The first successful ascent was made by Maurice Herzog in 1950. An epic story that you can read a book about.</p></div>
